        <h2>Where it all began</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2008 by a small team of passionate craftspeople, our journey started in a modest workshop with a simple belief: furniture should be built to last and designed to inspire.</p>
        <p>Today, we've grown into a full-scale operation, but our values remain unchanged. Every piece still receives the same attention to detail, the same commitment to quality, and the same respect for traditional craftsmanship that defined our earliest work.</p>
